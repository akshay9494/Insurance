# **Solvency II**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvency_II_Directive_2009

The key objectives of Solvency II were to increase the level of harmonisation of solvency regulation across Europe, to protect policyholders, to introduce Europe-wide capital requirements that are more sensitive (than the previous minimum Solvency I requirements) to the levels of risk being undertaken, and to provide appropriate incentives for good risk management. 

Aims

> EU insurance legislation aims to unify a single EU insurance market and enhance consumer protection. The third-generation Insurance Directives established an "EU passport" (single licence) for insurers to operate in all member states if they fulfilled EU conditions. Many member states concluded the EU minima were not enough, and took up their own reforms, which still led to differing regulations, hampering the goal of a single market.

# **IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 (International Financial Reporting Standards) - Probably not automatable**

https://ifrs17explained.com/2019/08/09/an-introduction-to-ifrs-9-and-ifrs-17/

Insurance companies who currently disclose under IFRS need to implement the new accounting standards; IFRS 9 and IFRS 17.

What is IFRS?

The goal of IFRS is to provide a global framework for how organizations (mostly listed firms) should prepare and disclose their financial statements. 
This is done in order to help stakeholders (including investors) with efficient information disclosures. 
IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 also serve this purpose but they focus both on specific topics; IFRS 17 on the insurance contracts and IFRS 9 on the financial instruments.

As a company, you’re always encouraged, or even expected, to improve, and contract management should be held to that same standard. Gain visibility into your contracts and contract process to identify and remedy pain points or gaps in order to provide the best service to your customers.


# Claims Management

https://www.vanameyde.com/what-is-claims-management/

We’re all confronted with damage at one time or other. You may accidentally cause damage to someone else’s property or find that your own property is damaged. Fortunately, you’ll have most of your possessions insured: your car, your home, your household effects. You are also likely to have travel and third-party liability insurance. All of these come under the heading ‘non-life insurance’. You don’t really know what your insurance policy will do for you until you actually suffer loss or damage. If this happens, it’s up to the loss adjuster or claims manager to settle your claim as quickly and efficiently as possible. When you notify a claim, you trigger a complicated process of which you, as the insured party, may be unaware of.

### What is Claims Management?

Claims management is a collective term for all work that Van Ameyde carries out for people or companies that suffer damage, as well as for the insurance provider. What does this work involve?

Registering the claim notification (by telephone, e-mail, post or online), which automatically opens the client file.
Checking the cover: is the damage insured and up to what amount? Asking for documents such as police reports of road accidents, medical reports in case of injury, invoices, etc.
Determining which party is liable for the damage if another party is involved.
Determining the amount of the claim and engaging a loss adjuster if necessary.
Arranging for the damage to be repaired or for transport back home if the damage occurs abroad.
Paying the claim to the insured party.
Recovering losses from liable (responsible) third parties, if applicable.
Reporting to our client (the insurance provider), including management information, showing e.g. the progress of all their claims files and the total amounts to be reserved and paid.
Fraud prevention checks.

In addition to the competitive environment in which insurance companies operate, these businesses are challenged by more stringent compliance with government regulations and increasing expectations on the part of consumers. Efficient claims management is vital to the success of both large and small companies working within the insurance industry. Major components of the claims handling process include developing strategies to cut costs and reduce fraud while keeping customers satisfied. Small companies in particular can benefit from claims management tools and technology.

### Settling Claims

Settling insurance claims is just one aspect of the claims management process. The time it takes to process a claim involves several stages beginning with a person filing a claim. The stages that follow determine if a claim has merit as well as how much the insurance company will pay. Insurance customers expect a company to settle claims quickly and to their satisfaction. Because high customer satisfaction levels can give a company a competitive edge, reducing the time it takes to settle insurance claims is one way to decrease the number of customer complaints and improve service. The use of claims management system software that speeds the process and minimizes costs offers a practical solution. Simplifying the claims process through automation helps reduce expenses for smaller companies that operate with smaller budgets.

### Detecting Fraud

Paying fraudulent claims costs insurance companies money -- a cost the insurance industry then passes on to its customers. Consequently, underwriting guidelines become tougher and the insurance premiums consumers pay increase. Software tools designed to examine payment history and evaluate trends in claim payoffs can help insurance companies detect fraud, according to Wipro, a global IT business. For example, how often the same individual files an insurance claim can be a warning that a person might be filing a fraudulent claim. Unfortunately, settling claims too quickly increases a company’s chance of paying out on a greater number of fraudulent claims. Unlike large companies that can absorb some losses as a part of doing business, small companies quickly suffer the negative effect on net earnings when paying fraudulent claims. Then again, processing insurance claims too slowly increases the risk of losing dissatisfied customers. In a highly competitive insurance market, small companies can't afford to lose customers.

### Lowering Costs

Monitoring costs throughout the claims management process determines how much of a customer’s premium rate goes toward paying for the insurance company’s administrative costs. Generally speaking, when settling a claim is delayed, it costs the insurance company more money. The higher claim costs reduce profitability. For small and large insurance companies alike, automation of some of the claims management process can help decrease a company’s operating costs. One example is the increased cost of investigating a claim manually. Information technology systems, though, improve efficiency by decreasing the number of claim errors, detecting fraud early and reducing the time it takes to process and settle a claim -- all factors that cut an insurance company’s costs and increase profitability. Even in a healthy economy, running a small business can be tough. Other essential functions of the claims management process that can reduce costs include developing programs directed at preventing claims before they occur and avoiding future claims.

### Avoiding Litigation

In most cases involving insurance claim disputes, the insurance company eventually agrees to pay an equitable amount if a customer has a legitimate claim and can present evidence supporting it. Although quickly settling a claim can avoid the chances for litigation, accurate liability assessment is crucial to achieving a quick resolution in a claim dispute. Insurers work to evade litigation because it substantially increases the company's cost of settling a claim. For instance, one-time cases where a person misrepresents information he provides on an insurance application can be expensive for an insurance company to prove legally. Causing a company financial loss is another reason to avoid litigation. Small insurance companies are not immune but rather are increasingly exposed to potential litigation involving claim disputes.
